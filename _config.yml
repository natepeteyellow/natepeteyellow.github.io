  <h2>About me:</h2>
  Hi there, I'm Nathen- a quantitative social scientist based in Washington, DC. Outside my day job, I'm driven by my research interests and my passion projects- I am particularly fascinated with interpersonal dynamics and leveraging statistics to model people's behaviors, social networks, and interactions. In a previous life I studied studied experimental psychology and applied statistics at Columbia; these days I'm intrigued by traditional statistics and theory-driven machine learning.
