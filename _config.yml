  <h2>About me:</h2> 
  <br><br>
  I'm a quantitative social scientist based in Washington, DC. My day job is being a data scientist for KPMG's Digital Lighthouse practice, where I deliver analytical solutions to federal clients.
  <br><br>
  Outside the office I am driven by my research interests and my work. I am fascinated with interpersonal dynamics and leveraging statistics to model people's behaviors, social networks, and interactions. In a previous life I studied studied experimental psychology and applied statistics at Columbia; these days I'm intrigued by traditional statistics and theory-driven machine learning.
